- Zero tracking, 100% local processing
- Use the least amount of resources possible
- Be accurate

## Non-goals

- Provide detailed information
- Do statistics with the data

# Help!
If you know Rust and think that you can improve the interface, please do! It's not the primary goal, but it's very welcome :)

Also, if you happen to think that you can improve the program in any other way, it's very much appreciated.
